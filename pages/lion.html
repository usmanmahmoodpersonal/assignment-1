    <p>The lion is a majestic and powerful big cat that is commonly referred to as the "king of the jungle." With its distinctive golden mane and muscular build, the lion is instantly recognizable and has long been a symbol of strength, courage, and royalty. Lions are social animals that typically live in prides consisting of a dominant male, several females, and their cubs. They are skilled hunters that prey on a variety of animals, including antelopes, zebras, and even buffaloes. Despite their fearsome reputation, lions are also vulnerable and are currently classified as a vulnerable species due to habitat loss, poaching, and other threats.</p>
