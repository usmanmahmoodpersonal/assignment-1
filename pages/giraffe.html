    <p>The giraffe is a tall and graceful African mammal that is well known for its long neck, which can reach up to six feet in length. They are the tallest land animals in the world and can grow up to 18 feet tall. Giraffes have a distinctive spotted pattern on their fur, which helps them blend in with the surrounding vegetation and avoid predators. They are herbivores and use their long necks to reach high branches and leaves on trees that other animals cannot reach. Giraffes are social animals and often live in herds, which can consist of up to 20 individuals. Despite their impressive size and unique features, giraffes are facing threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and climate change, which has led to a decline in their population in recent years.</p>
