    <p>Sharks are a diverse group of fish that inhabit oceans all around the world. They come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, with some species growing to be over 40 feet long. Sharks are apex predators and are known for their sharp teeth and powerful jaws, which they use to catch their prey. They have an acute sense of smell and can detect their prey from miles away. Sharks have a reputation for being dangerous, but they typically only attack humans when they mistake them for prey. Sharks are an important part of the ocean ecosystem and play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy balance of marine life. However, many species of sharks are currently endangered due to overfishing and other human activities, which threatens their survival and the health of the ocean ecosystems they inhabit.</p>
